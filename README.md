# Drawboy, a weaving helper

Drawboy is a tool to help with the handweaving process. It can load a WIF file, and 
assist with the winding, threading and weaving process.

Drawboy was written to be run on a Raspberry Pi with a foot switch to advance the current thread or row. Despite that, it doesn't require a Raspberry Pi.
